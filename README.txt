Hello fellow FoxHunt enjoyer!

To compile the bot, I have used Python version 3.7.8rc1 and pyTelegramBotAPI 4.9.0. Make sure both are installed!

Install Telegram Bot API via CMD with:
	python -m pip install pyTelegramBotAPI

To run the bot, open CMD and just run the .py file (python compiler obv)

There should be pleny comments in the code to have a rough understanding of how everything works

Art is generated using Dall E 2

Project file indexing is relative
File structure should be the following:
	main.py
	|_____
	|	| hints
	|
	|_____
		| pics

Notification of anybody finishing the FoxHunt will be sent via the console on which you are running the script to combat cheating.

The first question key is given, hence everybody will start at the same point.

To-Do:
o Audio hint implementation
o Location hint implementation
o Random start key and start location support
o Add eastereggs

If there's anything you need help with, don't hesitate contacting me
